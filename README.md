# Perth Housing Analysis 

## Project Description
This project utilizes a Perth housing dataset to analyze influences on Perth housing prices from 1990 to 2020. The dataset includes information on 322 Perth suburbs, including address, price, number of bedrooms, and more.

This project utilises a Perth housing dataset found from Kaggle to analyse influences in Perth housing prices from 1990 to 2020.
The data set consists of data from 322 Perth suburbs with the following parameters: 

| Address | Suburb | Price | No. Bedrooms | No. Bathrooms | Garage | Land Area | Floor Area | Build Year | CBD distance | Nearest Station | Nearest Station Distance | Date Sold | Postcode | Latitude | Longitude | Nearest School | Nearest School Distance | Nearest School Ranking |

## Data Sources

To support our analysis, we utilized the following resources:

1. [Kaggle Perth House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syuzai/perth-house-prices?resource=download): This dataset forms the core of our analysis, containing information about Perth housing from 1990 to 2020.
2. [Data WA Western Australian Schools Lists](https://catalogue.data.wa.gov.au/dataset/western-australian-schools-lists/resource/c11a690c-65c1-4cb8-87eb-182fd820c898): We used this dataset to determine the government vs. non-government status of schools in our dataset.
3. [GeoapTify API](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/): This API helped us obtain longitude and latitude data for postcodes for mapping purposes.

## Research Questions 
We aimed to answer the following questions to better understand housing market trends in Perth between 1990 and 2020:

## House sales in Perth â€“ Background information
- Number of houses sold per year.
- Best month and year of sales.
- Number of houses sold per suburb.
- Average house prices by suburbs

## Influences on house prices - Analyses
- Is there a price trend between houses in the South vs North of the Swan River?
- Does the ranking of schools in the area affect house prices?
- Does the type of school (government vs. non-government) affect house prices?
- Does the distance from the city affect house prices?
- Does the proximity of schools and train stations affect house prices?
- Percentages of bedrooms and bathrooms?
- Does land area influence pricing?

## Limitations: 
- The dataset is static, providing data only up to 2020, which may not reflect current trends (as of September 2023).
- School rankings and statuses may change over time.
- Additional information about house types or apartments could improve the accuracy of the analysis.

### Challenges: 
Generally as UWA Data Analytics student in our 7th week, we are limited in our resources and skills in data analysis, therefore in the future more concrete and substantial findings may be able to be extracted should the same dataset require analysis.
